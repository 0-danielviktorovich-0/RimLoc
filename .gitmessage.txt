#
# - expose parse_simple_po helper and PoEntry for shared use
# - reuse shared types in importer/validator, drop local duplicates
# - update XML helpers to call the core-level parser export
#
# Release commit template:
#
# chore(release): prep crates for crates.io (0.1.0-dev.0)
# - Bump all RimLoc crates to 0.1.0-dev.0
# - Add versioned deps for path crates; add metadata (license, repo, docs)
# - Exclude logs from CLI package
