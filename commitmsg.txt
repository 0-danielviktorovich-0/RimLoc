feat(cli,i18n,tests): introduce test-only FTL, localize test messages, unify UI output

### Summary
- Added dedicated test-only Fluent files:
  - `crates/rimloc-cli/i18n/en/rimloc-tests.ftl`
  - `crates/rimloc-cli/i18n/ru/rimloc-tests.ftl`
- Migrated all `cli_integration.rs` messages to localized `tr!(...)` lookups.
- Introduced and applied consistent UI macros (`ui_ok!`, `ui_info!`, `ui_warn!`, `ui_err!`, `ui_out!`)
  to replace ad-hoc `println!`/`eprintln!` usage.
- Added localized warning for unsupported UI language codes.

### Details
- **Tests**:
  - All hardcoded strings inside integration tests replaced with FTL keys.
  - Introduced `rimloc-tests.ftl` files to hold test-only messages,
    separated from user-facing localization files.
  - Ensured Russian and English variants are fully in sync.
- **Main binary**:
  - Localized CLI output (scan, validate, import, export, build).
  - Unified console messages via `ui_*` macros.
- **I18n**:
  - Verified parity of keys between `en` and `ru`.
  - Added new keys `ui-lang-unsupported`, `warn-unsupported-ui-lang` and ensured
    placeholders (`{ $code }`, `{ $lang }`) match across locales.
- **Build**:
  - Updated `build.rs` and i18n loader wiring to include test-only FTLs.

### Motivation
This change removes all remaining hardcoded English strings from tests and CLI output,
achieving full coverage of localization across both runtime and integration tests.
It also simplifies future maintenance: any new test messages go into `rimloc-tests.ftl`
instead of cluttering main localization files.

### Next steps
- Run tests in both locales (`EN` and `RU`) in CI to prevent drift.
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md with i18n rules (keys parity, block ordering).
- Consider adopting macros for error handling (`panic!`) in the future.

BREAKING CHANGE: none (public CLI behavior unchanged; only localized output affected).
