Русская версия доступна по ссылке: [docs/readme/ru/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](docs/readme/ru/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in the RimLoc project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people;
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback;
- Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience;
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project as a whole.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

- The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind;
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission;
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the project maintainers. You can reach the current maintainer via:

- GitHub Issues or Discussions (tagged `code-of-conduct` for visibility);
- Direct contact with the repository owner on GitHub (`@0-danielviktorovich-0`).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction** — private, written warning that the behaviour was inappropriate, with guidance on how to avoid recurrence.
2. **Warning** — official warning with consequences for continued inappropriate behaviour, such as temporary restrictions from interaction or collaboration.
3. **Temporary Ban** — temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period.
4. **Permanent Ban** — permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
