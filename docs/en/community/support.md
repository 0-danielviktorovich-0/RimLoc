# Support RimLoc

RimLoc is an open‑source project. If it saves you time or helps your team, consider supporting its development — even a small contribution makes a difference.

## Ways to support

- Star the repository on GitHub and share it with others.
- File helpful issues with logs and minimal repros; improve docs with PRs.
- Sponsor development (one‑time or recurring):
  - GitHub Sponsors (if enabled for the maintainer)
  - Ko‑fi: https://ko-fi.com/your-handle
  - Buy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/your-handle
  - Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/your-handle
  - DonationAlerts: https://donationalerts.com/r/your-handle

If you need an invoice or a specific platform, open an issue or contact the maintainer.

## What your support funds

- New features and formats (exporters/importers)
- Better docs, examples, and test fixtures
- Maintenance, security updates, CI/CD and release infrastructure

Thank you for helping RimLoc grow!
